/**
 * 代表着异步的计算，提供了计算是否完成的 check，等待完成，取回等多种方法
 * A {@code Future} represents the result of an asynchronous
 * computation.  Methods are provided to check if the computation is
 * complete, to wait for its completion, and to retrieve the result of
 * the computation.
 *
 *
 * 得到结果可以使用 get，会一直阻塞到结果计算完成。
 * The result can only be retrieved using method
 * {@code get} when the computation has completed, blocking if
 * necessary until it is ready.
 * 取消可以使用 cancel，一旦计算完成，就无法被取消了
 * Cancellation is performed by the
 * {@code cancel} method.  Additional methods are provided to
 * determine if the task completed normally or was cancelled.
 *
 * Once a computation has completed, the computation cannot be cancelled.
 *
 * If you would like to use a {@code Future} for the sake
 * of cancellability but not provide a usable result, you can
 * declare types of the form {@code Future<?>} and
 * return {@code null} as a result of the underlying task.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Sample Usage</b> (Note that the following classes are all
 * made-up.)
 * <pre> {@code
 * interface ArchiveSearcher { String search(String target); }
 * class App {
 *   ExecutorService executor = ...
 *   ArchiveSearcher searcher = ...
 *   void showSearch(final String target)
 *       throws InterruptedException {
 *     Future<String> future
 *       = executor.submit(new Callable<String>() {
 *         public String call() {
 *             return searcher.search(target);
 *         }});
 *     displayOtherThings(); // do other things while searching
 *     try {
 *       displayText(future.get()); // use future
 *     } catch (ExecutionException ex) { cleanup(); return; }
 *   }
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * The {@link FutureTask} class is an implementation of {@code Future} that
 * implements {@code Runnable}, and so may be executed by an {@code Executor}.
 * For example, the above construction with {@code submit} could be replaced by:
 *  <pre> {@code
 * FutureTask<String> future =
 *   new FutureTask<String>(new Callable<String>() {
 *     public String call() {
 *       return searcher.search(target);
 *   }});
 * executor.execute(future);}</pre>
 *
 * <p>Memory consistency effects: Actions taken by the asynchronous computation
 * <a href="package-summary.html#MemoryVisibility"> <i>happen-before</i></a>
 * actions following the corresponding {@code Future.get()} in another thread.
 *
 * @see FutureTask
 * @see Executor
 * @since 1.5
 * @author Doug Lea
 * @param <V> The result type returned by this Future's {@code get} method
